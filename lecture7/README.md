# Lecute 5 -- ControlSystems.jl and Simulation

See the two notebooks in this folder. Also see the [ODE introduction notebook](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DiffEqTutorials.jl/blob/master/notebook/introduction/ode_introduction.ipynb)

Things talked about today:
- [ControlSystems.jl](https://github.com/JuliaControl/ControlSystems.jl)
- [MonteCarloMeasurements.jl](https://github.com/baggepinnen/MonteCarloMeasurements.jl)
- [DifferentialEquations.jl](http://juliadiffeq.org/)
- [ControlExamples.jl](https://github.com/JuliaControl/ControlExamples.jl)

## Homework
Something control related. A few suggestions:
- Solve [issues](https://github.com/JuliaControl/ControlSystems.jl/issues) in [ControlSystems.jl](https://github.com/JuliaControl/ControlSystems.jl)
- Implement new feature in [ControlSystems.jl](https://github.com/JuliaControl/ControlSystems.jl). We have a few suggestions, such as
  - auto-vectorization macro
  - Better polce placement algorithm
- Translate a lab/exercise from matlab to julia
- Create a new computer exersice
- Suggest your own topic.

You are expected to work 1-2 days on this homework based on the number of course credits.
