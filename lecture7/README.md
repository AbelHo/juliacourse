# Lecute 5 -- ControlSystems.jl and Simulation

See the two notebooks in this folder.

Things talked about today:
- [ControlSystems.jl](https://github.com/JuliaControl/ControlSystems.jl)
- [ControlSystemIdentification.jl](https://github.com/baggepinnen/ControlSystemIdentification.jl)
- [MonteCarloMeasurements.jl](https://github.com/baggepinnen/MonteCarloMeasurements.jl)
- [ControlExamples.jl](https://github.com/JuliaControl/ControlExamples.jl)
- [SpectralDistances.jl](https://github.com/baggepinnen/SpectralDistances.jl)
- [LPVSpectral.jl](https://github.com/baggepinnen/LPVSpectral.jl)

## Homework
Something control related. A few suggestions:
- Solve [issues](https://github.com/JuliaControl/ControlSystems.jl/issues) in [ControlSystems.jl](https://github.com/JuliaControl/ControlSystems.jl)
- Implement new feature in [ControlSystems.jl](https://github.com/JuliaControl/ControlSystems.jl). We have a few suggestions, such as
  - auto-vectorization macro
  - Better pole placement algorithm
- Translate a lab/exercise from matlab to julia
- Create a new computer exersice
- Suggest your own topic.

You are expected to work 1-2 days on this homework based on the number of course credits.
